# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os is a paper-pencil game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
The numbering of boxes in my game is done as follows:
                       7 8 9
                       4 5 6
                       1 2 3
You can choose your symbol (X or Y) and play this game.
